# Speed-Enhancement-of-RSA-Algorithm

### Setting up the parallel environment
1. Refer the PPT Approach for detailed seps.
2. Download two files - master and slave from drive link mentioned here (master : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kC1V9IX9YHDyJf0A_yAcPGB0as4pkoK8/view?usp=sharing and slave : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sSv9fUnzEwJOjbOUJ3nFJohtKby98Waz/view?usp=sharing).

### After setup
1. After the master and slave nodes are established, go to master node and write the program from rsa.c
2. Follow the commands in Approach PPT to run the program.
3. Refer screenshots file to get an idea of the working.

For detailed description of the project, see report pdf.
